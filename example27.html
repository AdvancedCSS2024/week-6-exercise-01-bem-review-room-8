      In what scenarios is it advantageous to use a class name that represents
      the animal, and in what scenarios would it be preferable to use a generic
      name like 'product_01' or 'product_02'?
    </p>
    <p>
      Answer: Give the class a name that represents the animal if it is a class
      containing several instances of that animal. Name it something like
      "product_01" for the item within the "animalname" category
